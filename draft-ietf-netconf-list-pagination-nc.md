--- abstract

   This document defines a mapping of the list pagination mechanism
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-list-pagination] to NETCONF [RFC6241].

   This document updates [RFC6241], to augment the &lt;get&gt; and &lt;get-
   config> "rpc" statements, and [RFC8526], to augment the &lt;get-data&gt;
   "rpc" statement, to define input parameters necessary for list
   pagination.

# Introduction

   This document defines a mapping of the list pagination mechanism
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-list-pagination] to NETCONF [RFC6241].

   This document updates [RFC6241] and [RFC8526], as described in
   Section 2.

   While the pagination mechanism defined in this document is designed
   for the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241], the augmented RPCs MAY be used by
   the RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] if the RESTCONF server implements the
   "ietf-list-pagination-nc" module.
   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342]

##  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

##  Conventions

   Various examples in this document use "BASE64VALUE=" as a placeholder
   value for binary data that has been base64 encoded (per Section 9.8
   of [RFC7950]).  This placeholder value is used because real base64
   encoded structures are often many lines long and hence distracting to
   the example being presented.

#  Updates to NETCONF operations

##  Updates to RFC 6241

   The &lt;get&gt; and &lt;get-config&gt; rpc statements are augmented to accept
   additional input parameters, as described in Section 3.

# Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions of RESTCONF resource
   collection over the years, in particular,
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-collection] which provides enhanced
   filtering features for the retrieval of data nodes with the GET
   method and [I-D.zheng-netconf-fragmentation] which document large
   size data handling challenge.  The authors would like to thank the
   following for lively discussions on list (ordered by first name):
   Andy Bierman, Martin Bj√∂rklund, Robert Varga, and Robert Wilton.
